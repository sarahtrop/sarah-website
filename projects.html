            <p>This upcoming semester - spring 2017 - I will be working on creating an animated short film, about two to three minutes in length with a fellow student at Grinnell. Neither of us have worked on a project like this before, and are very excited about the learning opportunity and to create something that no student at Grinnell has done as a project in the past. The following description of our project is an excerpt from our project proposal, written by myself and by project partner Halley Freger.</p>

            <p>We will be creating a short film combining hand-drawn and digital animation. Over the course of this project we will specifically explore the use of temporality and visual effects in animation as a vehicle for expressing non-traditional narratives. Furthermore, it is our goal to create a piece of film that will present a compelling representation of a contemporary topic in under three minutes.</p>
 
            <p>By nontraditional, we mean that it does not necessarily follow a chronological order and a direct pattern of causality. This is in contrast to more traditional story structures, in which there   exists a rising action, climax, and falling action. Because the illusion of time and space can easily be manipulated in animated film, it lends itself well to nontraditional narratives.</p>

            <p>Combining nontraditional narratives and blended animation, our film will focus on a young woman navigating the world and how she is continuously denied autonomy over her body. We will present a young woman in various situations in which people (and the oppressive forces they represent) assume access or control over her body. Our film will raise questions about how young women can have agency over their bodies.</p>

          <p>The purpose of this program is to simulate the basic evolution of virtual creatures via natural selection. Creatures and plants are represented in data by pointers to C++ classes that are stored in one dimensional arrays. Upon the start of the program, 44 creatures (40 herbivores and 4 carnivores) are instantiated at random locations with all traits set to 128. A task queue is then initialized to assist with the program’s execution. In an infinite loop, the actions of the creatures for this tick are determined. This step is run in parallel via a thread queue as all creatures can act independently.</p>

          <p>Afterwards, all creatures have their positions updated and collisions are detected and handled. Collisions require serial execution as this step requires creatures to be handled and modified in pairs and therefore doesn’t lend itself well to parallelization. To compensate, great care was taken to ensure only the code strictly necessary for a creature’s processing is run. After all creatures have been updated, new plants are generated. Plants and creatures are then drawn on a bitmap and statistics concerning the state of the simulation are recorded. The updated bitmap is displayed, and the program sleeps until a predetermined amount of time has passed between the start and end of this tick to preserve visual continuity.</p>

          <p>This program was created as a final project for <a href="http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~curtsinger/teaching/2016S/CSC213/" target="_blank">CSC 216: Operating Systems and Parallel Algorithms</a> at Grinnell College, in the spring of 2016 with Christopher Kottke and Fengyuan Li. See the code and run it for yourself <a href="https://github.com/sarahtrop/213-project" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

          <p>The purpose of this game is to create a basic text adventure, in which the player can move though predetermined rooms and interact with objects and people to learn about their environment. Instead of a "choose your own adventure" type game, I chose to create a more exploratory game, based in the events of "The Harmony of the Spheres", a short story by the American author Salmon Rushdie.</p>

          <p>Just before this assignment, I acted in a student written and directed adaptation of Rushdie's story as Lucy Evans, the wife of the schizophrenic writer Eliot Crane. I loved being a part of the production, and know the story inside and out after working so closely with the text for two months. In the text adventure, the events of the story have already taken place, and the player must determine what has happened to Eliot Crane.</p>
          
          <p>The player can move through Eliot and Lucy's house, interact with the objects in the house, and possibly interact with Lucy as well as her friends Khan and Mala. The player collects points as they complete actions, and every few turns they are provided with more information. Most of the text in the game is my paraphrasing of the text, but some of the things Mala, Khan, and Lucy say are taken directly from the adaptation written by Joseph Knopke and Bridget O'Malley for the play.</p>

          <p>This program was written as the final assignment for <a href="http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~osera/courses/csc207/16sp/schedule/10-text-adventure.html" target="_blank">CSC 207: Data Structures and Object Oriented Programming</a> at Grinnell College, in the spring of 2016. See the code to play the text adventure <a href="https://github.com/sarahtrop/csc207-hw10" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <p>The Powesheik County Resource Portal is a project I worked on for my Team Software Development for Community Organizations class. I worked on it for what was the third semester students had been developing this application, which was built for Mid-Iowa Community Action. The purpose of the portal is to create a place to hold the resources that MICA has for Powesheik County (and eventually, the rest of the state of Iowa) in a format that is more user friendly than the current 60 page PDF document where the information is stored.</p>

          <p>While working on this project, I tested and finished old code from previous semesters that now implements an admin invitation system so not just any user can be an administrator (meaning they can edit and approve resources submitted to the portal by regular users), as well as implemented a user interface for non-admins. I also integrated a favoriting system for the resources, so they can be saved by users and now can also be printed in a printer-friendly format.</p>

          <p>The project is now finished, and is in the process of being deployed to MICA for immediate future use. The code can be found at: <a href="https://github.com/CSC322-Grinnell/resource-portal" target="_blank">CSC 322 Resource Portal</a>. I worked on this application from September to December of 2016.</p>
