							<h1>What I've Been Up to Lately</h1>
							
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/appdev logo.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h4><a href="http://appdev.grinnell.edu">Grinnell AppDev</a></h4>
							I recently became a designer on the Application Development team, Grinnell AppDev. AppDev is a team of select Grinnell College students who work to design and develop mobile applications usable within the Grinnell community. AppDev will be also be expanding to non-Grinnell specific mobile apps in the near future. My first project was to re-design the members page of the AppDev website, using Sketch, which was a new challenge since most of my design experience is based in the Adobe Design Suite. </p>

							<h4>Computer Science Mentoring</h4>
							This semester I am I mentor for the introductory Computer Science Course at Grinnell, CSC 151 - Functional Problem Solving. This class is conducted in the Scheme langauge using DrRacket. I took this class previously as a part of my major and enjoyed it immensely, so when I was asked to be a mentor, I jumped at the opportunity. I love mentoring CSC 151, and hope I get more chances to do it in the future.</p> 
							
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/grinnell.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h4>ALSO Italian Tutoring</h4>
							I am also an Italian tutor in the Alternative Language Study Option at Grinnell, a program that provdes individual driven learning for languages not taught at the college with peer tutors whom are fluent in the chosen language. This semester I am tutoring Italian II one other tutor, with whom I work closesly to structure the curriculum and the activities we construct for interactive learning during our biweekly tutoring sessions with the students. I am also crafting a new online curriculum using the Haiku Learning platform to supplement the in class activities.</p> 
							
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/grinnell.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h4><a href="http://www.thesandb.com">The Scarlet &amp; Black</a></h4>
							I have also been working as a freelance photographer for my college’s newspaper, The Scarlet &amp; Black, on a regular basis for the past one and a half years. My assignment changes on a weekly basis and ranges from portraits, sports, to campus events. Last semester, I participated in a new program within the newspaper in which first-year photographers shadowed upperclassmen to learn the full scope of the newspaper photography process – from picking assignments to taking the photos, editing in Adobe Photoshop and finally submitting to the paper.</p> 
							
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/bush.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h4>Tykoe Yearbook</h4>
							Prior to Grinnell, I was an editor for my high school yearbook. I used the Adobe Design Suite for editing photographs and laying out the individual pages of the yearbook, as well as creating a diverse spread of page designs while keeping steady to the chosen theme. </p>
							
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/smithsonian.png" alt="" /></span>
							<h4>Smithsonian Arctic Studies Center</h4>
							In 2013, I was an intern in the Arctic Studies Center working under Dr. Bill Fitzhugh. My project consisted of using Adobe Photoshop to edit photographs taken by the naturalist Edward Nelson during an Alaskan expedition in the late 1800s (the photographs were originally taken on glass plates) to enhance the digital quality and make the subject matter more easily discernible. After editing the photographs, I paired them with Nelson’s diaries using the cross-referencing found in the diaries and mentions in the book that Nelson wrote when he returned from Alaska. I then catalogued the photographs and their references in the diaries and Nelson’s book in a short database for future use by the Smithsonian. This project will eventually be a part of the ASC’s website on Edward Nelson. While at the ASC, I also digitized several thousand slides from various exhibits and research expeditions sponsored by the ASC.</p>
